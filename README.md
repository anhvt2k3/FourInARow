# FourInARow

Four in a Row is the classic two player game where you take turns to place a counter in an upright grid and try and beat your opponent to place 4 counters in a row.

The game is played with a seven-column and six-row grid, which is arranged upright. The starting player is randomly chosen, pick a game piece color (yellow or red) and can place a piece in any column. Each player then alternately takes a turn placing a piece in any column that is not already full. The piece fall straight down, occupying the lowest available spot within the column or be stopped by another piece. The aim is to be the first of the two players to connect four pieces of the same colour vertically, horizontally or diagonally. If each cell of the grid is filled and no player has already connected four pieces, the game ends in a draw, so no player wins.
